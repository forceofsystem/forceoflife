**Hello!**

## Introduction

I'm Patrick Zhang, a software engineering student at Sichuan University in China. I'm a fan of systems (you can check this category through [csrankings](https://csrankings.org/)), especially in the field of programming language (compiler and program analysis), computer architecture, and operating systems.

My favorite software is [vim](https://www.vim.org/), which is a powerful text editor. And I'm a fan of [Bram Moolenaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar), the author of vim, who has already pass away in 2023. I want to write a software which make a difference to the whole world like vim in my life.

In the english version site, I usually write cs-related blogs (especially about compiler), if you want to read more my personal thinking, you can change to the chinese site by click the `中文`. If you meet any problems related to my articles or just want to chat with me, feel free to  [email to me](zhixiao-zhang@outlook.com) (zhixiao-zhang@outlook.com).

## Environment

I have two laptops, a Macbook Air M1 and a second-hand ThinkPad T480 to provide x86-64.

I like Linux at most, because it is an open-source operating system. I can do whatever I want to do on it. I find it's convenient to write code on linux, because it's easy to set the environment by the package manager. Moreover, my favorite distribution is gentoo linux, which is a source-based distribution. I like the moment when I compile the software by myself, and it can be relatively stable compared to arch linux which is also the rolling release. However, I use Debian on my laptop now, because I wanna save time to do other things, and more importantly, save the electricity bill lol. Debian is a comparable stable and extremely powerful distribution, it's easy to use.

I use Macbook Air M1 as my main laptop, because it's stable, and maintain a great balance between development and life. It's posix compliant, but its default animation is more smooth and UI design is more beautiful than Linux. Though I use Windows when I was a child, I don't like it, because it usually dumps, and it's not stable. But I still use it to play games and use some softwares which only support Windows.
